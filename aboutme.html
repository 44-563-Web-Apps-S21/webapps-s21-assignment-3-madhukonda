        <h1>3D-Man</h1>
        <p>
            3D-Man possesses the powers of flight, superhuman strength, x-ray vision, heat vision, 
            cold breath, super-speed, enhanced hearing, and nigh-invulnerability. While Superman 
            is immensely strong both in terms of muscle power and ability to take physical punishment,
            he is not all-powerful.
            Superman's only other known weakness is magic, which can injure him as easily as it can 
            any other being. Magical beings are able to injure the man of steel easily.
            However, at one time Superman said that he hasn't shown his full power because "he feels
            like like he lives in a world full of cardboard" and the risk he could kill someone in 
            the Justice League Unlimited finale, "Destroyer".
